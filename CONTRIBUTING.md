## CONTRIBUTING
### Development
If you wish to add new features just fork the repo, add your features and make a pull request. Don't forget to join the Discord to discuss about your changes

Visio needs some specific dependencies installed on your system. Refer to [go-face requirements](https://github.com/Kagami/go-face#requirements)

You can also create issues for bugs and feature requests. I don't have any specific template for creating issues, just make sure to be as understandable and nice as possible :)

Thanks
