# VISIO
## Introduction
Visio is an opensource cloud based service that provides algorithms for face detection and recognition. It is still in active development and is not feature complete yet but is stable enough to be
used in small to medium scale projects.

## Docs
The documentation is still being written as I am still actively working on the project.
### Refer to my [blog post](https://www.thewisepigeon.tech/posts/introducing-visio) as the official docs for now
